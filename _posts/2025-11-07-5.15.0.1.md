## Improvements

### REST API v3
- **API Key Permission Synchronization** - API keys now automatically update their scopes when user permissions or roles change. When custom role permissions are modified, unauthorized scopes are removed (#7557)

### System Monitoring
- **Enhanced Tracking Error Visibility** - Invalid sale/action format errors in tracking requests are now logged as critical events instead of debug-level messages. These errors trigger application notifications in the merchant panel. Previously, malformed tracking requests could go unnoticed in regular logs (#7570)

## Bug Fixes

### Audit Logs
- **Parent Affiliate Assignment Tracking** - Fixed missing audit log entries when parent affiliates are automatically assigned from cookies after signup (#7579)

### User Management
- **Custom Role Deletion Messages** - Improved error message when attempting to delete a custom role that is currently assigned to users. The system now displays a clear, user-friendly message (#7567)

### Affiliate Payments
- **Campaign Name Filter** - Fixed "Campaign name" custom filter in the "Pay affiliates" section that was returning incorrect results and showing data from all campaigns instead of filtering by the selected campaign. The filter now works correctly, matching the behavior in the Transactions section (#7551)

### Background Tasks
- **Session Management** - Fixed issue where manually executing the "Visit log processor" task from Pending Background Tasks would unexpectedly log users out. The task now properly maintains user session during execution (#7549)

### Forms & Validation
- **Password Reset Security** - Added maximum length validation for username and captcha fields on password reset forms. Username field is now limited to 255 characters (SMTP standard), captcha field limited to 4 characters (#7493)

### User Interface
- **Affiliate Promotion Screen Layout** - Fixed layout and styling issues on the Promotion screen in affiliate panel (#7568)
