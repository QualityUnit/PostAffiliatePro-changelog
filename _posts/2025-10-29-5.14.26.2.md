## Security
- **Possible XSS vulnerability** (#7540)

## Improvements

### REST API v3
- **Transaction Filtering** - Added filter support for `id` and `data1-data5` columns in `/api/v3/transactions` endpoint, allowing more precise transaction queries. Transaction responses now include data field values (#7532)
- **API Key Management** - API keys now persist when users change their password or activate two-factor authentication. Previously, all API keys were automatically deleted during these security actions. The system now displays a notification about managing keys in the API v3 settings (#7522)
- **Affiliate Form Fields** - Introduced new `/api/v3/affiliate/form-fields` endpoint that returns form field configuration available to affiliates. This complements the merchant endpoint with affiliate-specific field access (#7501)

### User Experience
- **ListBox Empty Values** - ListBox profile fields now support empty values as a valid option. Merchants can configure listboxes with an empty line, allowing affiliates to select "no value" instead of being forced to choose from predefined options (#7531)
- **Banner Cloning** - Added ability to set new description and image alt text when cloning multiple banners simultaneously (#7509)
- **Password Change Validation** - Users can no longer reuse their current password when changing it, ensuring actual password changes for improved security (#7486)
- **Theme Discovery** - Added "NEW" badge next to the Theme settings button and Summer theme option in Design settings, making it easier for existing users to discover the newly released modern theme (#7475)

## Bug Fixes

### Email System
- **Inline Image Display** - Fixed issue where inline images in email templates weren't displayed in recipients' inboxes. Images embedded in automated notification emails (like Affiliate - New User Signup Approved) now appear correctly (#7530)

### User Interface
- **Country List Scrolling** - Fixed scrolling issues in country selection dialogs for SmartLinks and Fraud Protection features (#7519, #7533)
- **Save Button Position** - Fixed "Save modified rows" button overlapping tooltips in Affiliate Manager when using Summer or Coupe themes with minimized left menu (#7478)

### Banner & QR Code
- **QR Code Logo Support** - Fixed "Logo source not found or invalid" error when using the default system logo in QR codes. New customers can now use the QR code logo feature immediately without uploading a custom logo (#7514)

### Tracking System
- **Sale Parameters** - Fixed critical tracking issue where `ChangedCommission` and `DoNotDeleteCookies` parameters in direct calls to `/scripts/sale.php` were completely ignored. These parameters now work correctly (#7548)

### Theme Management
- **Import Validation** - Added validation to theme import process to prevent importing themes with missing or invalid original theme references. System now properly validates themes before import, preventing errors when viewing Design configuration screens (#7544)

### Affiliate Signup Fields
- **Referral ID Validation** - Fixed incorrect validation on "Configure Referral ID" screen where switching between pattern options would incorrectly validate the previous option's settings. The system now only validates the currently selected pattern type (#7538)

### Data Privacy
- **Callback Anonymization** - Fixed Anonymize transaction data fields plugin to properly mask data in affiliate callbacks. Transaction data fields are now anonymized in callback notifications, matching the masking behavior shown in the affiliate panel (#7484)
