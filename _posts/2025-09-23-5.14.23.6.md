## New Features

### Modern Interface Design
- **Summer Theme** - New modern theme available for merchant panels, affiliate panels, and mini-sites featuring contemporary design, and PAP's official blue color scheme (#7378, #7423)

## Bug Fixes

### Affiliate Management
- **Private Campaign Filtering** - Fixed issue where the "Affiliates approved in private campaign" filter wasn't displaying affiliates who were added to commission groups with Fixed, Ascending, or Descending status within private campaigns. The filter now correctly shows all affiliates approved in private campaigns regardless of their commission group status (#7450)

### Email System
- **Image Display Reliability** - Resolved problem where images embedded in email content would stop displaying after several days due to automatic file cleanup. Images are now properly referenced from email attachments ensuring consistent display (#7428)
- **Attachment Optimization** - Fixed duplicate image attachments where inline images in email templates were being sent as both embedded content and separate attachments. Inline images now appear only in the email body (#7345)

## Plugin Updates

### Payment Gateway Integrations
- **ccBill Product Information** - Enhanced ccBill plugin to capture product information from webhooks using custom variables (#7459)
- **Shopify Recharge Order Management** - Fixed duplicate commissions caused by identical order IDs for multiple products (#7453)

### User Management
- **Affiliate ID Generation** - Fixed issue where the "Generate Affiliate User ID as autoincremented sequence" plugin generated user IDs could match existing referral IDs. The system now properly skips conflicting IDs (#6390)
