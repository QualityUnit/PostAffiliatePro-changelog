## New Features

### REST API v3
- **Modern REST API Implementation** - Introduced new REST API v3 with OpenAPI 3.0 specification, token-based authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling. Includes new API key management screen for merchants to create and manage integration keys (#7411, #6834)

### Enhanced Affiliate Selection
- **Referral ID Display in Affiliate Lists** - Added Refid column to affiliate listbox/select fields throughout the application, including transaction management, filters, and other screens where affiliates are selected. This makes it easier for merchants to identify affiliates when multiple affiliates share the same name (#7487)

## Improvements

## Bug Fixes

### Banner Management
- **QR Code Logo Support** - Fixed "Logo source not found or invalid" error when generating QR codes for subaffiliate signup with logos that have spaces in filenames (#7470)

- **Campaign Categories Filter** - Fixed broken design of campaigns categories filter in Campaigns manager when category list is long. Added height limit and scrolling functionality (#7446)

## Plugin Updates

### Payment Gateway Integrations

- **ccBill Tracking** - Fixed cookie tracking in ccBill plugin by implementing visitor ID tracking through ccBill's custom variables (custom1-custom5). Resolved issue where tracking cookies were not loaded due to ccBill's parameter naming restrictions (#7468)
