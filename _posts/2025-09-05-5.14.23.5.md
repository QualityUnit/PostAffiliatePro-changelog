## New Features

### Improved Click Tracking Accuracy
- *Facebook Prefetch Filtering* - System now automatically ignores Facebook's prefetch requests to prevent false click tracking when affiliate links are shared on Facebook (#7434)
- *Enhanced Bot & Crawler Protection* - Extended click fraud protection now properly blocks bots and crawlers even when custom user agents are used in server-to-server tracking calls (#6489)

### Enhanced Affiliate Recruitment
- *QR Code for Subaffiliate Signup* - Affiliates can now generate QR codes for their subaffiliate signup links directly in the Affiliate panel, making it easier to share recruitment links offline or via mobile devices (#7426)

## Bug Fixes

### Tracking Accuracy
- *Facebook Crawler Detection* - Fixed issue where Facebook's content crawlers were incorrectly tracked as legitimate affiliate clicks, improving click statistics accuracy (#7441)

### Performance & Stability
- *Large Campaign Report Generation* - Fixed memory exhaustion issue preventing report creation and email template editing in accounts with thousands of campaigns (13,000+). Template variables are now properly limited to prevent system overload (#7418)
- *Affiliate Manager Form Persistence* - Resolved issue where the Affiliate Manager form retained unsaved changes when reopened, now properly reloads with current data each time (#7408)

### User Interface
- *Tooltip Positioning* - Fixed tooltip overflow issue where information tooltips could extend beyond screen boundaries when displayed near viewport edges, now dynamically adjusts position (#7399)

## Plugin Updates

### Stripe Integration
- *Promo Code Tracking* - Fixed inconsistent coupon tracking to properly record promo codes instead of coupon IDs, ensuring accurate tracking when multiple promo codes exist for a single coupon (#7439)
